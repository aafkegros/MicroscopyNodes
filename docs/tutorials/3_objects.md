# 3. Objects

Microscopy Nodes loads your microscopy data as different types of **objects**, depending on how you loaded each channel.

![mic nodes objects](../figures/outliner_objects.png)

Each type of object is placed in a {{ svg("outliner_ob_empty") }}  **holder** collection. The **Axes** and **Slice Cube** are always present.

You can select an object by clicking on it in the {{ svg("outliner") }} outliner (as shown in the screenshot) and change its properties:

- Change **underlying data** in the {{ svg("modifier") }} modifier menu of the {{ svg("properties") }} properties or the (*advanced*) Geometry Nodes workspace {{ svg("workspace") }} 
- Change **visualization** in the {{ svg("material") }} material menu of the {{ svg("properties") }} properties or the Shader Nodes workspace {{ svg("workspace") }} 

The exact settings and where to change them change per object, so see below.

---

## Holder 

The {{ svg("outliner_ob_empty") }} **Holder** is an empty object which is the `parent` of the other Microscopy Nodes objects. 

The holder can be **scaled**, **moved** and **rotated** and then **all of its objects** will be transformed along with it.

## Axes

The  {{ svg("outliner_ob_mesh") }} **Axes** object is always loaded with your dataset. It draws a **scale grid** based on the number of pixels, pixel size, and pixel unit.

-  {{ svg("modifier") }} Geometry options
    - `pixel unit` per tick
      > The distance between grid lines
    - Grid
      > Whether to draw a grid or only a box 
    - Line thickness
      > Thickness of lines in arbitrary units
    - Frontface culling
      > If ticked, clips out the axes that are closest to the camera or viewpoint, so that they do not obstruct the view.
    - Separate planes
      > For each plane (xy bottom, top etc) you can select whether they will be drawn

-  {{ svg("material") }} Shader options
    - Color 

Scale grids can be **moved**, **scaled** and **rotated** independently of the holder without losing their accuracy.

!!! note "Bars versus grids"
    In *Microscopy Nodes*, only scale grids are shown. Blenderâ€™s default cameras are perspective cameras, where traditional scale bars are not very meaningful. We'll probably add support for some form of scale bar in the future for orthographic renders.

## Volumes

The {{ svg("outliner_ob_volume") }} **Volume** holds channels of **volumetric** data, which can be rendered either as emitting or scattering light. It is generated when you enable {{ svg("outliner_ob_volume") }}  **Volume** during loading.

-  {{ svg("modifier") }} Geometry options
    - Included channels
      > If channels are not included, they are also not loaded into RAM 
-  {{ svg("material") }} [Shader options](./4_shading.md#volume-shading)
    - Pixel intensities
    - Opacity calculation
    - Color LUT

The easiest way to edit a volume shader is in the {{ svg("workspace") }} Shader Nodes workspace, where you can most easily switch between channels in the {{ svg("properties") }} properties.

You can toggle between emission and scattering modes using the {{ svg("light") }} emission toggle in [loading](./2_loading_data.md).

## Surfaces

The {{ svg("outliner_ob_mesh") }} **Surface** object is a mesh extracted from a volume using an **isosurface threshold**. It is generated when you enable {{ svg("outliner_ob_surface") }}  **Surface** during loading.

- {{ svg("modifier") }} Geometry options
    - Included channels
    - Threshold
      > The intensity value above which the surface is extracted. 
    - Voxel size *(only listed if {{ svg("preferences") }} [Mesh Resolution](./preferences.md) is not `Actual`)*
      > Interactive scalable unit for mesh detail

- {{ svg("material") }} [Shader options](./4_shading.md#surface-shading)
    - Standard mesh shading parameters (color, opacity etc)



---

## Label Masks

The {{ svg("outliner_ob_mesh") }} **Label Mask** object is a mesh generated from a **label image**, such as a segmentation channel. It is generated when you enable {{ svg("outliner_ob_pointcloud") }}  **Labelmask** during loading.

**Each value** in the volume is turned into a separate mesh.

- {{ svg("modifier") }} Geometry options
    - Included channels

- {{ svg("material") }} [Shader options](./4_shading.md#labelmask-shading)
    - Color per label 
    - Revolving colormap or linearly distributed among objects
    - Standard mesh shading parameters (color, opacity etc)

---

## Slice Cube

The {{ svg("outliner_ob_mesh") }} **Slice Cube** is a movable object that defines the visibility of other objects.

The slice cube is inherently nothing else than a Cube with a transparent shader. The linkage to its transparency is done from the {{ svg("material") }} shader **of the sliced object**. This means you can also add a new cube and point to this instead.

This has no {{ svg("modifier") }} Geometry options or {{ svg("material") }} Shader options

???+ info "How the **Microcopy Nodes** objects work"
    The data objects are Geometry Nodes objects that reference preloaded data stored in the `cache` collection. In the **Geometry Nodes** workspace {{ svg("workspace", "small-icon") }} you can add edit the loaded data and add modifiers.
