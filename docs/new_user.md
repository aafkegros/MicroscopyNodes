## Installing Microscopy Nodes
You can download and install the add-on on the [Blender extensions platform](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/microscopynodes/) or by searching for Microscopy Nodes in the Extensions in your Blender preferences. For installing with earlier Blender versions than 4.2, follow the [legacy install instructions](./outdated.md).

The add-on will then show up as a window in the `Scene Properties`.
